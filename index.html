  <h1>The 2020 Pandemic</h1>
  <p>The Pandemic of 2020 — The Corona Virus, first identified in the late 2019 in Wuhan, China set off one of the the global destructions the world might ever encounter. </p>
  <br>
  <img class="virus-img"src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTwdZy0SeXbha4LfGJDGHcAO_axJD6XESrjPw&usqp=CAU" alt="corona img">
  <h2>The History</h2>
  <p>Covid-19 is also called SARS-CoV-2, which is because the Virus is known to be originated in bats, or in other meats which might include pangolins, the same way SARS was identified in the early 2003. This Covid-19 has now become a deadly Respiratory disease transmitting itself from one person to another and is spreading across the globe, causing the deaths of millions.</p>
  <p>The Corona Viruses are a family of 7 Viruses that are also responsible for the breakout of the MERS — Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and SARS — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Viruses, including the current Corona Virus — Covid-19.</p>
  <p>The SARS was first identified in Southern China in late 2002, infecting 8000 people and killing no more than 800, While the MERS first brokeout in Saudi Arabia in 2012, which is less contagious than the SARS infecting 2500 people, but a lot more deadly causing 858 known deaths.</p>
  <br>
  <img class="corona-img" src="https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202005/covid-19-MITGOVLAB.png" alt="corona-img">
  <h2>How Covid-19 Transmitts</h2>
  <p>The virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre. A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 1 metre.
  People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus when touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>1st and the 2nd Waves</h2>
<p>There are 2 waves recorded of Covid-19 in many countries. However, the First Wave and Second Wave had various differences, including,</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Black Fungus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Mucormycosis, or also called Black Fungus is a rare but serious infection being detected frequently among Covid-19 patients in some states.</li>
    <li> It is caused by a group of moulds known as mucormycetes present naturally in the environment. It mainly affects people who are on medication for diseases like Corona Virus.</li>
    <li>While it is treated with antifungals, mucormycosis may eventually require surgery that can lead to loss of the upper jaw and sometimes even the eye.</li>
    <li>Sinusitis;</li>
     <li>Blackish discoloration over bridge of nose</li>
     <li>Loosening of teeth, jaw involvement</li>

  <h1>Vaccination</h1>
  <p>If 2020 was dominated by the news of how COVID-19 spread across the globe, then 2021 has so far been focused on ending the pandemic through vaccine distribution.</p>
  <p>The first vaccine for Covid-19 in India was COVAXIN. However, a small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes it. These are called “vaccine breakthrough cases.” And a few side effects of the vaccine which are normal include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site.</p>
  <p>As for the available vaccines in India, Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson single-dose Covid-19 vaccine make 5 of them. The 7 vaccines approved by W.H.O include Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, AZD1222, Covishield, BBIBP-CorV, CoronaVac.</p>

<!-- Conclusion -->
<section id="conclusion">

    <h1>Conclusion <i class="fas fa-virus"></i></h1>

    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed our lifestyles, from our morning routines to our life goals and priorities. Life might not be the same way as before and some changes must be made in order to ensure the past will never repeat.</p>
    <p>The pandemic might be the most unexpected thing that happened this century, however, we need to be prepared incase situations threaten us in the future. "Hope for the best, Prepare for the worst." as they say, let's be more aware of unexpected situations which might cause global disasters like Covid-19, so that the same destruction will not be repeated.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2><i class="fas fa-head-side-mask"></i> Masks</h2>
    <p>Masks are one of the most prevention strategies because they provide a barrier that can keep respiratory droplets from spreading. Not only for the virus, but we can also put on masks if infected with a common cold or flu to stop it's transmission to another person.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Mental Health <i class="fas fa-user-alt"></i></h2>
    <p>There was a huge rise in  the percentage of adults who reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, increasing from 36.4 to 41.5 % from August 2020 to February 2021. This has been described as "The second pandemic" as well. Reports show that juggling work and childcare, job loss, isolation, and losing a loved one to COVID-19, having COVID-19 may contribute, too, with its lingering or long COVID symptoms, which can include “foggy mind,” anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2><i class="fas fa-fist-raised"></i> Survival of the Fittest</h2>
    <p>As Charles Darwin said, Only the fittest will be the survivors especially when an unexpected pandemic would cause destruction to the entire world. With no effective treatment options, survival against the coronavirus infection depends completely on the person’s immune response.</p>
    <p>Life lessons we learnt include, Willingness to sacrifice some of the freedom for the greater good of the public, Washing hands- maintaining general hygeine whether there is a virus or not, and the importance of maintaining relationships with family or friends.</p>
